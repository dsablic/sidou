# Design notes

Why SIDOU's code is the way it is, by area. Code carries no explanatory comments; the decisions
behind it live here. Cross-cutting decisions also have records in [decisions/](decisions/).
The cleanup before 1.5's release moves the decisions now written as code comments here.

## Hardware

- The FM-1's CPU faults on any misaligned 16- or 32-bit RAM access; fm1-emu does not model it.
  Structures copied word by word, especially in the audio interrupt, are aligned to 4 bytes with
  a static assertion (1.1's ARP helper crash). Genuinely packed data is read and written with
  byte copies (`memcpy`), never through a wider pointer.
- Every emu-gate test enforces the rule: `common::step`, which `Machine::run_cycles` and the
  bench runners use, steps through a bus that panics on a misaligned 16- or 32-bit RAM access,
  naming the PC, the address and the width. The check is one mask and branch per access; the
  `lab` binary ran as fast with it as without (under load, within noise). The JIT runs
  (`run_ms_jit`: the settled first boot) and `decode_gate`'s scratch steps are not checked; the
  first boot is also run stepped in `boot.rs`. The first sweep with the check on for every test
  (1.5, 2026-10-31) found no misaligned access in SIDOU's code, Felucca's `usb.c` or
  `third_party/`; with 1.1's fix reverted it fails at once on the draft copy's word store
  (`song_draft`).

## Flash and build flags

- The app slot is 581,564 bytes; each release plan sets a ceiling, `IMAGE_CEILING` in emu-gate's
  `tests/flash_plan`, which `flash_budget.rs` and `psid_budget.rs` both check (`psid_budget.rs`
  kept a copy once, stale at 552,000 through 1.1). A compile-time assertion keeps 13,564 bytes
  of the slot free above the ceiling for felucca-bsp and later.
- The ceilings by plan: M2a 372,000, M2b 384,000, M2c 414,000, M2d 440,000, M2e 452,000, M2f
  512,000; M3 534,000 (its 506,000 start plus 28,000); 1.0 552,000 (LAB's estimate and 1.0's
  small features, the user's raise on 2026-10-28); 1.1 556,000 (after a 3-5 KB win-back, the
  user's decision on 2026-10-29); 1.5 568,000 (after a 2-4 KB win-back, 2026-10-30). A raise is
  the owner's decision, recorded in the release's plan.
- Cold code builds at `-Os`/`-Oz`; files on instruction-budget paths keep `-O2`. `gt2_song.c`
  stays at `-Os`: at `-Oz` it moved four LCD goldens, cause not yet found.
- The voice shadow (`core/sid/sid_shadow.c`, the .sid player's main-loop copy of the voices)
  runs from flash but calls the chip's own out-of-line voice helpers (`sid_osc_run_combined`,
  `sid_osc_advance_slow`, `sid_noise_clock`, `sid_noise_settle_deferred`, `sid_env_run`,
  `sid_env_advance_slow`) in SRAM through the `*_far` pointers `sid.c` exports
  (`SID_VOICE_FAR`): a direct call cannot reach SRAM from flash (docs/hardware.md, "Call range").
  It saved 7.3 KB of flash copies and leaves `sid.c`'s SRAM code byte for byte as it was. The
  shadow still reads its envelope tables from flash (`SID_ENV_TABLES_IN_FLASH`), and builds
  with `-fno-function-sections` so that none of the helpers it still instantiates is taken
  into SRAM by app.ld's name patterns.

## Controls

- EDIT + SCL, EDIT + ARP and EDIT + LFO are chords whichever finger lands first: a hand's two
  fingers rarely land together. One mechanism (`screen_lone` in `app/screen.h`) serves LAB, STEP
  and TRACKER: a button pressed without EDIT is remembered while it stays down. EDIT pressed
  then makes it the chord. Its lone action is either done at its press (`SCREEN_LONE_DONE`:
  LAB's ARP and LFO, STEP's LFO) or held back (`SCREEN_LONE_HELD_BACK`: SCL's next effect slot,
  STEP's ARP gate, TRACKER's key off and rest with REC on) until it is let go or another control
  is used, which does the held-back action first.
