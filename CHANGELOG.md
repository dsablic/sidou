## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Design document, licensing, credits and contribution guidelines.
- SID core in C11 (`core/sid/`): oscillators, noise, hard sync and ring
  modulation, envelope generator with the ADSR delay bug, a
  zero-delay-feedback state-variable filter with reSID 0.16 cutoff curves,
  mixer and DC blocker, for the 6581 and the 8580.
- Rust host workspace (`host/`): FFI to the C core, unit and golden-render
  tests, and a criterion benchmark.
- reSIDfp reference harness: pitch and envelope tests, and the
  `sidou-compare` filter comparison tool.
- Pinned JieLi pi32v2 toolchain in Docker, and a bare-metal pi32v2 benchmark
  program.
- Emulator benchmark gate: runs the pi32v2 build in fm1-emu, enforces 900
  instructions per sample per chip, and checks the output against the host
  build.
- CI: host tests on Linux and macOS with UBSan; ASan on Linux; MSRV check, REUSE lint,
  and the firmware build with the emulator gate.
- Building and testing guides, and decision records for the host tooling
  and the M0 SID cost.
